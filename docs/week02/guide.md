# Debian Fundamentals and First Service (SSH) (Lab 2)
Students will build a strong foundation in Debian Linux by learning core system concepts, user management, package management, and services. This lab introduces SSH as the first real services and prepares the system for hosting services in future labs.

# Environment
    VMware Workstation Pro (Windows/Linux)
        We do not have support for M chip based Macs at the moment

    DePaul SecLabs Virtual Desktops
        These virtual desktops act as a basic Debian Desktop environment. All of the labs can be done in the virtual lab but we encourage to do it on your device.

# Target Audience
    Beginner-friendly, step-by-step, assumes no prior knowledge of Linux system administration.
    Students are expected to have completed Lab 1 or already have a working Debian 13.2 VM.
