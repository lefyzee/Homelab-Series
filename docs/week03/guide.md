# Hosting a Local Minecraft Server (Lab 3)
This week we will deploy and manage a local Minecraft server on Debian. Students will learn how to install Java, configure a service, manage server processes, and host a multiplyer service inside a virtual machine.

This lab builds directly on Week 2's Linux fundamentals and takes it to the next step by actually running a service. 

# Environment
- Debian 13.2 (Server)
- VMware Workstation Pro
- Local only networking
- Can use the NETlabs although VMware is encouraged

# Target Audience
Beginner friendly but introduces real service hosting concepts. Assumes students completed Lab 2. **If you did not complete lab 2 or do not have VMware installed please use the NetLabs**

# Learning Objectives
- Install and verify Java runtime
- Download and deploy a Minecraft Server
- Configure server
- Accept software licenses properly
- Monitor CPU and RAM usage
- Configure a firewall rule
- Connect to a locally hosted service
- Understand ports and service binding
